==AbstractSyntaxTeam - 6.035 Compiler
==================
This is a decaf compiler as created by a group I formed for the project.
It is fully functional and has several optimizations. The optimizations currently implemented are:

Common Subexpression Elimination
Dead Code Elimination
Constant Folding
Copy Propagation
Efficient Assembly (a hack on our generated assembly to remove/compress inefficient instruction sequences)
Register Allocation
